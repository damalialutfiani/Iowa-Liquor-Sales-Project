# Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Project
This is a project that I worked on based on an assignment or study case given for the Mini Course Data Analytics training by Revou which was held from 27 June untill 8 July 2022.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three stages to working on this study case, namely Defining Questions, Data Exploration, and Data Visualization with Insights.

First, before determining the Defining Question, it is necessary to do a Data Preview to see what data will be processed and a description of each data so that it is more structured to work on it.
Then for Data Exploration using BigQuery SQL to sort out the data and prepare it for use (ready to be visualized).
The next step is to perform Data Visualization, for this visualization Google Data Studio is used.
Furthermore, how to deliver the data visualization that we have made so that it is easy to understand.

Then for the Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Project file in the form of a PDF file, it is an explanation file or working steps for this project.
