# Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Project
Analyzing data from Liquor Sales In Iowa. From Data Cleaning to Data Visualization with Insights.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Context

The Iowa Department of Commerce requires that every store that sells alcohol in bottled form for off-the-premises consumption must hold a class "E" liquor license (an arrangement typical of most of the state alcohol regulatory bodies). All alcoholic sales made by stores registered thusly with the Iowa Department of Commerce are logged in the Commerce department system, which is in turn published as open data by the State of Iowa.

> Content

This dataset contains information on the name, kind, price, quantity, and location of sale of sales of individual containers or packages of containers of alcoholic beverages.

This is a project that I worked on based on study case given for the Mini Course Data Analytics training by Revou which was held from 27 June untill 8 July 2022.

**There are three stages to working on this study case, namely :**
1.  Defining Questions
2.  Data Exploration
3.  Data Visualization with Insights.

**First, before determining the Defining Question**, it is necessary to do a **Data Preview** to see what data will be processed and a description of each data so that it is more structured to work on it.

**Second, for Data Exploration** using BigQuery SQL to sort out the data and prepare it for use (ready to be visualized).

**The next step is to perform Data Visualization**, for this visualization Google Data Studio is used.
*Furthermore, how to deliver the data visualization that we have made so that it is easy to understand.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a description of the file used :
1. The **Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Project.pptx** file in the form of a PPT file, it is *an explanation file or working steps for this project.*
2. Then file with pdf extension (**Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Project.pdf**) is a pdf version file of Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Project.pptx.
3. The **query.sql** file is a file that is *used to view data and explore data* which is then ready to be used for data visualization.

#### [NOTES!] In this project, we use Google BiqQuery and Google Data Studio for visualization. ####
